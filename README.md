# ActionRpgTutorial
An rpg following tutorial on youtube

Features I want to add
- Aggro mechanic for npcs and enemies
- Inventory systems
- Dynamic Spawning of enemies
- Boss enemies

Stuff I need to do to improve development process
- Add files to gitignore, use https://answers.unity.com/questions/22604/which-unity-project-files-can-be-ignored-for-versi.html for help. Currently every commit has a bunch of rubbish files that show unconsiquential changes.
